Learn the Basics to Check, Fix, and Understand Your Network

### üåü Introduction

If you are new to Linux system administration or just getting started with networking, learning some basic commands will make your life much easier. These commands help you check network settings, test connections, transfer files, and even troubleshoot issues.

In this guide, we'll go through **20 must-know networking commands** with simple explanations and examples so you can practice them right away.

#### 1\. `ip a` (or `ifconfig`)

**What it does:** Shows your computer's network interfaces and IP addresses.

**Modern Alternative:** `ip address show`

```bash
ip a
```

üëâ Use this when you want to know **your system's IP address**.

#### 2\. `ping`

**What it does:** Tests if another computer/website is reachable.

```bash
ping google.com

**Pro tip:** Use `-c 5` to limit ping count.

```bash
ping -c 5 google.com
```

**What it does:** Shows the path your data takes to reach a server.

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

#### `ss` (modern replacement for `netstat`)

**What it does:** Lists active network connections and open ports.

**Modern Alternative:** `ss -tuln`

```bash
ss -tuln
```

üëâ Great for checking which ports your system is listening on.

#### 5\. `dig` (or `nslookup`)

**What it does:** Checks DNS records of a website.

```bash
dig openai.com

```

#### 10\. `tcpdump`

**Tip:** üëâ Use filters (like `port 80`) to avoid too much output.

#### 11\. `ethtool`

**What it does:** Shows details of a network card.

```bash
ethtool eth0
```

#### 12\. `nmcli`

**What it does:** Manages connections using NetworkManager.

```bash

```

#### 13\. `systemctl status ssh`

**What it does:** Checks if SSH service is running.

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

#### 14\. `ufw` (or `iptables`)

**What it does:** Manages firewall rules.

#### 15\. `ip link`

**What it does:** Shows details of all network interfaces.

```bash
ip link show
```

#### 16\. `netplan` (Ubuntu 18+)
